<br>1. À la seconde: “To the second position” or “to the side,” as in plié à la seconde or grand battement à la seconde.
<br>2. À terre: on the ground indicates a movement.
<br>3. Adagio: “Slow tempo.” In ballet, a tempo in which the dancer moves slowly and gracefully.
<br>4. Allegro: “Brisk tempo.” In ballet, a tempo in which the dancer moves briskly and excitedly.
<br>5. Allongé: “Elongated.” An adjective used to describe poses that are stretched and elongated, like an arabesque.
<br>6. Arabesque: A pose in which the dancer stands on one leg—either straight or demi-plié, and either flat-footed or en pointe—while extending the other leg straight behind at a right angle. The shoulders are square with the arms held to create a long line from fingertips to toes.
<br>7. Arriére: Backwards A move that indicates backwards movement or motion.
<br>8. Assemblé: “Joined together.” A move in which a dancer brushes the toes of one foot along the ground, then brings both legs together in the air.
<br>9. Attitude: A pose in which the dancer stands straight on one leg with the other leg lifted in back or front and bent at 90 degrees. The arm on the side of the raised leg is curved over the head, and the other arm is held to the side.
<br>10. Ballon: “To bounce.” A light jump. Used to indicate the delicacy of the movement or jump.
<br>11. Battement dégagé: “Disengaged battlement.” A rapid back-and-forth movement of the non-supporting leg with the toes hovering just off the ground.
<br>12. Battu: “Beaten.” A step in which one foot is beaten against the other foot or leg.

<br>14. Cabriole: “Caper.” A jump in which the dancer extends their legs out from their body and beats their calves together before landing.
<br>15. Chaînés: chain or link A popular movement in which the dancer turns on both feet, bringing each foot up and back down in rapid succession that allows for quick movement.
<br>16. Changement: The changing of the foot position mid-jump en air, or in the air.
<br>17. Chassé: “To chase.” A triple-step pattern in which the feet glide together step-by-step.
<br>18. Coupé: to cut. Used to describe a step in which the foot replaces or cuts the opposite foot.
<br>19. Croisé: crossed The dancer’s body is diagonal to the audience, and their legs appear crossed.
<br>20. Dégagé: “Disengage.” Pointing the foot in any direction with a fully arched instep while the dancer’s weight remains on the straight supporting leg.
<br>21. Derrière: back or behind Typically paired with another pose or move to indicate a backwards movement.
<br>22. Devant: in front Indicates a move or position where the leg or arm is placed in front of the body.
<br>23. Developpe: “To develop.” Moving one leg up to the knee of the standing leg and slowly extending it in the air, holding the hips square according to the direction the dancer is facing.
<br>24. Effacé: “Shaded.” Indicates an open position for the legs.
<br>25. Écarté: “Separated.” A position in which the dancer faces one of the two front corners of the room. The leg nearer the audience is pointed in the second position or raised to the second position in the air. With the arm on the same side as the extended leg raised, the dancer turns their head up toward it and looks into the palm of the hand. The other arm remains in demi-seconde position.26. Échappé: Escaped When the feet move from a closed position (first, third, or fifth position) to an opening position (second or fourth position).source:<div id= "div4"> <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/a-basic-ballet-dictionary"> <li> Terminology </li></a> </div>
